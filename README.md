The Call History Gadget is now live! Installation instructions are <a href="https://github.com/bdm1981/finesseGadgets/wiki/Call-History-Gadget-Installation-Guide">Here</a>

*** UPDATE ***
Parse.com announced that they will be shutting down service January 2017. Unfortunately, they also stopped accepting new accounts. I have updated the gadget to use Firebase as the cloud DB. The installation instructions and code have been updated to reflect this.
